# TransportationEfficiencyCalculator
Simple calculator in Python to compare transportation methods of varying cost and time for businesses.

Calc.py is the entry file. Put all of these in the same folder and run "calc.py" in the terminal.

Calc.py imports option1.py and option2.py, and you can choose to run one or the other by running calc.py.
The two options are described in their files and in the question that the calc.py file asks you.
